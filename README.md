This is project 6 in the Treehouse FEWD Techdegree. In this project, I created a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using Javascript, I created an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board. I gave the player 5 lifes to guess the correct phrase.
